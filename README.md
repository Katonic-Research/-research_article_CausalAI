This app is about the research articles for **Salesforce CausalAI Library: A Fast and Scalable Framework for Causal Analysis of Time Series and Tabular Data.**

## Description

This article offers the open-source Salesforce CausalAI Library, which uses observational data to do causal analysis. It provides causal inference and causal discovery for discrete and continuous types of tabular and time series data. This library contains multiprocessing-based algorithms that can handle both linear and nonlinear causal interactions between variables.The library also provide a data generator that allows users to influence the ground-truth causal process while examining different methods. It can produce synthetic data with a predefined structural equation model for both of the mentioned data formats and types.
